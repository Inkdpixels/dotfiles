## Credits
This repo is based on the work of others, as a result I wont claim this as my work. Currently its just a mess of files and is not intended to be a fully working dotfile repo. Most of the work was done by...

* [@mathiasbynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) – [His dotfile repo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
* [@holman](https://github.com/holman) – [His dotfile repo](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)

...And probably more.
